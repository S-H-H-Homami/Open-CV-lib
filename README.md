# Open-CV-lib
The essentials of OpenCV
Some of the widely used commands in Open CV Libraries are listed along side their examples.
This repository is written as a refrence for my own future projects but is available for everyone to use it as a cheatsheet!
Intresting commands or examples will be added to this notebook every now and then.
